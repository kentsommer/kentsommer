I am currently a Software Engineer at Toyota Research Institute (secondeed to Woven Planet in Tokyo, JP). My out of work interests include tinkering with machine learning, computer vision, and mobile robotics projects. I have diverse US and international work experience across the fields of software engineering and robotics.
